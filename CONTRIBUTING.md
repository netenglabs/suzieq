# Contributing

Suzieq is an open source project focused on IP Network Observability.


We are just getting started with Suzieq and we appreciate any participation and collaboration.

The number one way we'd like your help is to try out Suzieq and tell us what would make it more 
effective for you. There are many directions we can take suzieq, any input would help a lot. 

[Add an issue](https://github.com/netenglabs/suzieq/issues/new) or 
discuss ideas at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/netenglabs-suzieq. Issues aren't for 
troubleshooting or problem solving, they are for bugs and feature requests. 

We've only added structure to this project as we need it. If you see that we are missing something
obvious and/or helpful, let us know. If you have ideas on how to make the project better, let us know.

We could use help in documentation, especially around structure.

There's always a need for better testing. We've focused on end-to-end testing and don't have as much
unit testing as we'd like. Any thoughts or contributions here would help a lot.
