coalescer:
  # The coalescer has the role to group the single parquet files into a bigger

  # every coalescing period. This value can be expressed using the following
  # notation <value><m,h,d,w>, where:
  # m: minutes (i.e. 30m )
  # h: hours (i.e. 12h )
  # d: days (i.e. 1d )
  # w: weeks (i.e. 3w )
  period: 1h
  # Comment the next line if you don't want the archive directory. This dir is
  # purely to save the uncoalesced data in raw format to avoid data loss in case
  # of a bug in the coalescer.
