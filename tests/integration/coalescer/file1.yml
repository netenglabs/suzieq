# Basic coalescer test adds testing for checking coalescer
# in the presence of multiple time windows. All of the data
# in the parquet files used for testing have a single time window
# IMPORTANT: Make sure these dates are modified if we ever take
# new data because that causes the new data to be returned as the
# latest data.
